A simple plugin to display the registration date of your Users on the Users List screen and the single User Profile screen.

## Description

Adds a sortable column with the registration date for each User on the Users list screen, within the WordPress Dashboard. The user registration date will also be shown on the single User Profile screen. Knowing the registration date is especially useful for sites with a large number of users, such as for eCommerce or membership websites.

The registration date will be displayed with respect to the timezone selected within the **Settings > General** screen. The displayed date on the single User Profile page will also honour the time and date formats selected within your settings.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'display-user-registration-date' folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
